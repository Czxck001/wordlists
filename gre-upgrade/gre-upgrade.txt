新 GRE 词汇进阶与巩固 GRE VOCABULARY UPGRADE
version beta (released) 曹天铖
使用说明
Gradation: 词汇学习并不是一步到位,而需要一个循序渐进的过程,这种进阶体现在难度和 熟练度两个维度。因此,希望各位考生首先确保自己有一定量的基础词汇(托福/雅思级
别),再进行 GRE 词汇的学习;同时,我们提供的词汇也是按照难度递增而逐步呈现。
Repetition: 科学的进阶过程也并不能保证记忆的有效性,尤其是对于短期内的突击式记忆。 最佳的记忆方式当然是通过大量的使用长期巩固,但是对于大多数备考时间有限的学生而
言,这一点并不现实。所以,短期内的不断重复就显得尤为重要。
Efficiency: 句子填空真的是 GRE 的重点么?GRE 又真的是申请的重点么?作为填空老师,我自 然希望大家重视这一门需要词汇量的学科;但是作为同样选择留学申请的学生,我确信的知
道,对于申请的大局而言,有太多比 GRE 更重要的事情。所以,有限的时间下,如何分配时 间就显得尤为重要:我们需要的不是一个不顾一切的最高分,而是一个最有时间效率,最合 理也最优化备考计划。
这次的 released 版本涵盖了 1080 个核心词条(包括英文释义/同反义词/对应的三种练习) 希望大家在使用的时候,尽可能的弱化“这个词如何翻译”的概念,而是试图去强化“这个词 在句子中可以表达什么意思”或者“这个词有什么关键特征”等等,这不仅仅是考试的需求, 更是大家转变思维方式,为国外的学习生活做准备的一个语言基础。因此标注为粗体/下划 线的部分是需要大家尤其关注的。
单词怎么样算记住了呢?大家常规的做法或许是用卡片遮住释义,看能不能说出单词的解 释。然而在实际考试中,我们要做的并不是去“默写”出选项的意思,而是要能够根据题干的
信息(即单词的“关键特征”)与选项做出匹配,是“连线题”而不是“主观题”。所以,主要大 家能够完成每个 unit 之后的 4 组连线题,对于考试而言,这些单词就算是认识了。
第二种练习考察大家对于同反义词的记忆,这种对于“异义词”的筛选,正是模拟大家在考场 上筛选选项的思维过程,在“并不完全知道单词释义”的情况下,也要迅速做出选择。
第三种练习的考察分为两个层次:基本层面上,这些练习等于部分单词的例句(来自于西方 的网络媒体),同时也是同义词替换的练习;更高层次上,我们希望通过这种练习,扩展学 生的“输出”词汇:想到“短暂”这个概念,大家一定背过很多词,可是到了需要表达“短暂”的 含义时,话到嘴/手边的就只有那么一两个单词;这样的练习强迫大家走出你所熟知的词汇 comfort zone,促使大家把仅仅“知道”的短期词汇转换成真正可以“运用”的长期词汇。这样的 目标或许并不是 GRE 的考试要求,但是却一定是各位终究需要实现的学术能力。
目前发布的是《进阶与巩固》这本书的第一部分(1080 核心词汇)后续还会添加以下内容:
1. 大约 500 个进阶词汇及相应练习
2. 大约 100 个常见的 GRE 短语(包括部分常见的外来语短语)
3. 近一年考试中出现的新词(包括个别单词的生僻意思)
4. 部分关于词根词缀的讲解
5. 单词的中文注释和音标
6. 音频资料?(这个目前只是设想)
由于时间准备的相对仓促,加之暑期是上课的高峰期,因此这个版本的内容不免会出现疏漏
或是欠妥当的地方,也希望各位试用版的读者能够给我们提出以下反馈意见,以及对于余下
几个部分的建议和期待。
